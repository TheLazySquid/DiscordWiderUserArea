# Discord Wider User Area

This is a [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) plugin that makes the user area at the bottom left of the screen expand left into the server list.

## Compatibility

I really tried my best to make this work with as many other themes and plugins as possible. Admittedly, this is pretty janky when used in conjunctions with the BetterAnimations flip transition, but it should fix itself after a few seconds. If you find any incompatibilities, please let me know by opening an issue.
